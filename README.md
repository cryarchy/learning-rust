# learning-rust

> With Python, I was content. With JavaScript, I am happy. I hear Rustaceans are
the happiest bunch in this world, so here I am, in pursuit for more happiness.

This repository contains rust notes mainly derived from
[The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/)
and programs from the same source or authored for learning purpose.

The content here is not intended to be useful to anybody else but me. If you
find it useful then *lucky you!*
