# Getting Started
## Shortcuts
View Docs Locally:  
- `rustup doc`

## Recommendations
- Use an underscore to separate multi-word filenames e.g *hello_world.rs*
- Put opening curly bracket on the same line as the function declaration,
with one space in between. e.g `fn main() {`
- Ident using 4 spaces not a tab.

## Slang
**crates** - packages of rust code

## Tooling
**cargo** - project manager for rust projects.

## Notes
- When you see a `!` you are calling a macro instead of a normal function.
